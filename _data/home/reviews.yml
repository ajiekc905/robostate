    body: A cool and interesting idea for kids to have fun while developing team and programming skills. The robots and playing field are completely new. Highly recommend these guys.


  - person: Natasha S.
    body: My 9 year old son loves his online classes. He likes that it's a combination of coding and engineering. What I like the most is that the group is small in size and my son always gets personal feedback end encouragement. He feels free to ask questions or share his opinion and he's looking forward to each class.

    body: My kids participated in competitions and they loved this fun experience and learnt a lot, so they decided to make STEM their future career choice.
